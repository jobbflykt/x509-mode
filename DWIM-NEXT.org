- Add a buffer variable that records the source buffer.
- Add a buffer variable that records the current point in the source buffer.
- NEXT should determine the curren active region in the source buffer
  and look for a region after it.
- If a new region is found, it should replace the content in the shadow-buffer
  and the x509 buffer should be regenerated as if x509-edit-params.
- Point should be moved in the source buffer and recorded.
- Similarly, PREV, can be implemented.
- Bind to n and p in x509-mode and x509-asn1-mode.
- If no next of prev region is found, just leave buffer unchanged and display a
  message in the message buffer.
